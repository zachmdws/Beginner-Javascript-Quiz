I designed a small quiz that is timed at 75 seconds featuring a series of questions. If you get one wrong 10 seconds are deducted from the countdown that can be seen at all times. If you get it right, you move forward until you reach the end. At the end of the quiz you are shown your final score and a submit box where you can enter your initials is also shown. After submitting your initials you are taken to the high-score board where you can view others' scores. At the bottom you have two options, Go Back to restart the quiz or Clear to clear the high-score board.
